## üîç DATA VALIDATION

Before sending to AI, verify these key numbers:

### From scenario_comparison.csv:
```
NGFS_NetZero2050:
  - Cumulative emissions = 1,189.6 MtCO‚ÇÇ
  - NPV total cost = $425.6B
  - Emissions reduction = 71.5%

NGFS_Below2C:
  - Cumulative emissions = 1,713.1 MtCO‚ÇÇ
  - NPV total cost = $414.2B
  - Emissions reduction = 34.2%

NGFS_NDCs:
  - Cumulative emissions = 1,980.5 MtCO‚ÇÇ
  - NPV total cost = $381.6B
  - Emissions reduction = 14.6%

NGFS_NetZero2050_NoCCUS:
  - Cumulative emissions = 1,323.9 MtCO‚ÇÇ
  - NPV total cost = $443.5B
  - Emissions reduction = 64.2%
```

### Carbon Budget:
```
POSCO allocation (2025-2050): 1,110 MtCO‚ÇÇ
Overshoot:
  - NZ2050: +7% (partial overshoot)
  - NZ2050 (No CCUS): +19% (overshoot)
  - Below2C: +54% (overshoot)
  - NDCs: +78% (severe overshoot)
```

**If these numbers don't match, you may need to update input data first!**
(See `DATA_UPDATE_PROMPT.md` for instructions)

## üìà POST-AI INTEGRATION STEPS

### 1. Insert Text into LaTeX
```bash
# Edit main manuscript
cd /Users/jinsupark/jinsu-coding/opt_posco/opt_posco
code main.tex  # or your preferred editor
```

### 2. Verify tables
```bash
# Review LaTeX tables for alignment with latest data
cd tables
rg "\midrule" scenario_comparison.tex
```

### 3. Update Figure References
```bash
# Ensure \ref{fig:emissions} matches actual figure labels
# Copy figures to figures/ directory if needed
cp outputs/figs/*.png figures/
```

### 4. Compile LaTeX
```bash
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

### 5. Proofread
- [ ] Check all figure/table references resolve
- [ ] Verify citations are in references.bib
- [ ] Read through for flow and coherence
- [ ] Check word count (~8,000-10,000 for Energy Policy)
