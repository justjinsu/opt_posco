## üîç DATA VALIDATION

Before sending to AI, verify these key numbers:

### From scenario_comparison.csv:
```
NGFS_NetZero2050:
  - Cumulative emissions = 613.6 MtCO‚ÇÇ
  - NPV total cost = $185.9B
  - Emissions reduction = 51.3%

NGFS_Below2C:
  - Cumulative emissions = 651.4 MtCO‚ÇÇ
  - NPV total cost = $185.1B
  - Emissions reduction = 21.0%

NGFS_NDCs:
  - Cumulative emissions = 757.3 MtCO‚ÇÇ
  - NPV total cost = $182.7B
  - Emissions reduction = 18.2%
```

### Carbon Budget:
```
POSCO allocation (2025-2050): 1,110 MtCO‚ÇÇ
Overshoot:
  - NZ2050: -6% (compliant)
  - Below2C: +16% (overshoot)
  - NDCs: +38% (severe overshoot)
```

**If these numbers don't match, you may need to update input data first!**
(See `DATA_UPDATE_PROMPT.md` for instructions)

## üìà POST-AI INTEGRATION STEPS

### 1. Insert Text into LaTeX
```bash
# Edit main manuscript
cd /Users/jinsupark/jinsu-coding/opt_posco/opt_posco
code main.tex  # or your preferred editor
```

### 2. Create Tables
```bash
# Export tables to LaTeX format
cd tables/
# Create .tex files for each table
```

### 3. Update Figure References
```bash
# Ensure \ref{fig:emissions} matches actual figure labels
# Copy figures to figures/ directory if needed
cp outputs/figs/*.png figures/
```

### 4. Compile LaTeX
```bash
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
