## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify Your Data (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/jinsupark/jinsu-coding/opt_posco/opt_posco

# Check that results exist
ls outputs/scenario_comparison.csv
ls outputs/analysis/

# If missing, regenerate:
python -m src.scenarios \
  --data data/posco_parameters_consolidated_v2_0.xlsx \
  --output outputs \
  --viz
```

---

### Step 2: Prepare Data for AI (10 minutes)

Open these files and copy their contents:

```bash
# Main results
cat outputs/scenario_comparison.csv

# Detailed analysis files
cat outputs/analysis/emission_trajectories_all_scenarios.csv
cat outputs/analysis/technology_transitions_all_scenarios.csv
cat outputs/analysis/cost_breakdown_all_scenarios.csv
cat outputs/analysis/carbon_pricing_analysis_all_scenarios.csv
cat outputs/analysis/emission_intensities_all_scenarios.csv
```

**Note:** If `carbon_budget_compliance.csv` doesn't exist, the model will generate it automatically - check the analysis directory.

---

### Step 3: Send to Economics AI (30-60 minutes)

**Recommended Platform:** Claude 3.5 Opus or GPT-4 Turbo

**Your Message:**
```

## üìä What You Currently Have (Excellent Quality!)

### ‚úÖ Complete Sections
- **Section 1: Introduction** - Research question, motivation, preview of findings
- **Section 2: Literature Review** - Steel decarbonization, carbon pricing, sectoral budgets
- **Section 3: Methodology** - Model formulation, constraints, scenarios
- **LaTeX Template** - Professional manuscript structure (`main.tex`)

### ‚úÖ Model Results
- **Three scenarios:** NZ2050, Below2C, NDCs
- **Key finding:** Even NZ2050 overshoots the 1,110 MtCO‚ÇÇ budget (1,189.6 MtCO‚ÇÇ; +7\%), highlighting the need for complementary reforms.
- **Policy gap:** NDCs scenario overshoots by 78\% (+870 MtCO‚ÇÇ) and Below2C by 54\% (+603 MtCO‚ÇÇ).
- **Technology mix:** Net Zero relies on 51\% BF--BOF+CCUS and 36\% scrap-EAF in 2050; hydrogen does not enter at baseline costs.
- **No-CCUS sensitivity:** Turning off capture under NZ2050 pushes cumulative emissions to 1,323.9 MtCO‚ÇÇ (+19\%), lifts hydrogen DRI to a 36\% share, and raises cumulative ETS payments to \$43B.

### ‚úÖ Visualizations
- 8 high-quality publication-ready figures
- Emission trajectories, technology transitions, cost breakdown
- Ready to include in paper

---

## üéì Current status of writing

Section 4 (Results) now explains the CCUS-plus-scrap transition, quantifies the overshoot, and incorporates hydrogen-cost and no-CCUS sensitivities (Section 4.4). Use the updated manuscript to polish narrative flow, tighten citations, and prepare for co-author review.

---

### Section 5: Discussion (~6 pages)
The revised discussion diagnoses the 80 MtCO‚ÇÇ adequacy gap, unpacks institutional barriers (free allocation, CCUS infrastructure, scrap logistics), and lays out the updated policy package. Use this section for refining citations and sharpening policy language.

### Section 6: Conclusion (~2 pages)
The conclusion now summarises the CCUS-plus-scrap transition, quantifies the residual overshoot, and reiterates policy reforms. Future work and limitations remain placeholders for any additional nuance you want to add.

## üìà Key Numbers the AI Must Use

From your current results:

| Metric | NZ2050 | Below2C | NDCs |
|--------|--------|---------|------|
| **Cumulative Emissions (MtCO‚ÇÇ)** | 1,189.6 | 1,713.1 | 1,980.5 |
| **Budget Overshoot** | +7% ‚ö†Ô∏è | +54% ‚ùå | +78% ‚ùå |
| **NPV Cost (Billion USD)** | $425.6 | $414.2 | $381.6 |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: CSV files don't exist
**Solution:**
```bash
python -m src.scenarios \
  --data data/posco_parameters_consolidated_v2_0.xlsx \
  --output outputs \
  --h2-case baseline \
  --viz
```

### Problem: AI output is too generic
**Solution:** In your message, emphasize:
- "Use EXACT numbers from the CSV data I provided"
- "Calculate specific thresholds and cite them with precision"
- "Compare quantitatively between scenarios"
- "Reference specific years and values from the data"

### Problem: Results don't match paper claims
**Solution:** Check if you need to update input data first:
- Current demand: ~35-40 Mt/y (too low?)
- Target demand: ~60 Mt/y (POSCO actual capacity)
- See `DATA_UPDATE_PROMPT.md` for adjustment instructions
