## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify Your Data (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/jinsupark/jinsu-coding/opt_posco/opt_posco

# Check that results exist
ls outputs/scenario_comparison.csv
ls outputs/analysis/

# If missing, regenerate:
python -m src.scenarios \
  --data data/posco_parameters_consolidated_v2_0.xlsx \
  --output outputs \
  --viz
```

---

### Step 2: Prepare Data for AI (10 minutes)

Open these files and copy their contents:

```bash
# Main results
cat outputs/scenario_comparison.csv

# Detailed analysis files
cat outputs/analysis/emission_trajectories_all_scenarios.csv
cat outputs/analysis/technology_transitions_all_scenarios.csv
cat outputs/analysis/cost_breakdown_all_scenarios.csv
cat outputs/analysis/carbon_pricing_analysis_all_scenarios.csv

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: CSV files don't exist
**Solution:**
```bash
python -m src.scenarios \
  --data data/posco_parameters_consolidated_v2_0.xlsx \
  --output outputs \
  --h2-case baseline \
  --viz
```

### Problem: AI output is too generic
**Solution:** In your message, emphasize:
- "Use EXACT numbers from the CSV data I provided"
- "Calculate specific thresholds and cite them with precision"
- "Compare quantitatively between scenarios"
- "Reference specific years and values from the data"

### Problem: Results don't match paper claims
**Solution:** Check if you need to update input data first:
- Current demand: ~35-40 Mt/y (too low?)
- Target demand: ~60 Mt/y (POSCO actual capacity)
- See `DATA_UPDATE_PROMPT.md` for adjustment instructions
