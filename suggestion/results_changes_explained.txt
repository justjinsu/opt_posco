Increase: +107%

WHY THE INCREASE?
- Added interpretation and "so what?" analysis
- Provided context for every finding
- Better transitions and signposting
- More accessible explanations
- Policy implications integrated throughout
- NOT just more numbers—more MEANING


STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS
========================

OPENING PARAGRAPH
-----------------
ORIGINAL (1 paragraph, 70 words):
"Carbon price trajectories reshape POSCO's emissions, production mix, and compliance costs in distinct ways. Table~\ref{tab:scenario-comparison} consolidates the headline metrics across the three Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) price paths. We first trace the evolution of emissions, then examine how technology portfolios adjust, quantify carbon-budget gaps, and conclude with the cost and competitiveness implications."

NEW (2 paragraphs, 180 words):
Opens with the CENTRAL FINDING upfront:
"Our optimization reveals a sobering but nuanced picture of carbon pricing effectiveness in driving industrial decarbonization. The central finding is unambiguous: even aggressive carbon pricing aligned with Net Zero 2050 targets fails to keep POSCO's emissions within its climate-consistent carbon budget."

Then provides roadmap organized around QUESTIONS:
"We organize our findings around four questions: Do carbon prices drive emission reductions? Which technologies actually get deployed? Can any price trajectory achieve budget compliance? And what are the cost implications for competitiveness?"

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Leads with the punchline instead of burying it
✓ Sets expectations clearly
✓ Uses questions to organize narrative
✓ Creates anticipation for what's coming
✓ More engaging tone ("sobering but nuanced")

WHY IT'S BETTER: Reader knows the main message immediately and has a roadmap for the section.


SUBSECTION HEADERS
==================

ORIGINAL vs NEW:

ORIGINAL: "Emission trajectories remain sensitive to price signals"
NEW: "Carbon prices drive substantial but insufficient emission reductions"

IMPROVEMENT:
- "Remain sensitive" is vague
- "Substantial but insufficient" tells the finding AND sets up tension
- Uses active voice
- More informative for skimming readers

ORIGINAL: "High carbon prices are the only trigger for low-carbon technologies"
NEW: "Technology transitions follow sharp price thresholds, not gradual shifts"

IMPROVEMENT:
- Emphasizes the PATTERN (thresholds) not just the fact
- More analytical
- Sets up the mechanism explanation

ORIGINAL: "Carbon budget compliance still fails without stronger prices"
NEW: "All carbon price trajectories overshoot the sectoral budget—even Net Zero"

IMPROVEMENT:
- "All...even Net Zero" emphasizes the severity
- More dramatic and attention-grabbing
- Makes the policy problem crystal clear

NEW HEADER (not in original subsection title):
"Higher carbon prices reduce total costs by substituting capital for compliance"

IMPROVEMENT:
- Counterintuitive finding highlighted in header
- Explains the MECHANISM upfront
- Challenges conventional wisdom


SUBSECTION 4.1: EMISSION TRAJECTORIES
======================================

ORIGINAL APPROACH:
- Listed emission numbers by scenario
- Brief mention of CCUS sensitivity
- Dense, technical

NEW APPROACH:
Added three analytical paragraphs:

PARAGRAPH 1: The Big Picture
"Carbon pricing works—but not well enough."
- Opens with clear verdict
- Quantifies reductions: 71% decline under Net Zero
- Provides context: "These reductions matter enormously"
- BUT transitions to inadequacy

PARAGRAPH 2: Interpretation
"Yet as we show in Section 4.3, even the most ambitious scenario still overshoots POSCO's allocated carbon budget. The price sensitivity is clear, but absolute price levels remain inadequate."
- Connects findings across sections
- Explicit interpretation of what numbers mean

PARAGRAPH 3: CCUS Dependency Analysis
"The No CCUS sensitivity reveals how dependent these pathways are on carbon capture technology."
- Explains what we LEARN from the sensitivity
- Quantifies the dependency: 26% higher emissions
- Policy implication: "carbon pricing alone cannot..."

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Every paragraph has a clear purpose
✓ Numbers support arguments rather than being the argument
✓ Explicit interpretation throughout
✓ Forward/backward references to other sections
✓ Conversational tone ("works—but not well enough")

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:

ORIGINAL:
"Stronger price paths still drive materially faster mitigation: with capture operating, the NGFS Net Zero trajectory cuts emissions from 81~MtCO$_2$ in 2025 to 23.1~MtCO$_2$ by 2050..."

NEW:
"The emission reductions are dramatic: under the Net Zero pathway, annual emissions fall from 81 MtCO$_2$ in 2025 to just 23.1 MtCO$_2$ by 2050, a 71\% decline."

IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Added interpretation: "dramatic"
✓ Calculated percentage: "71% decline"
✓ More active: "emissions fall" vs "trajectory cuts"
✓ More conversational: "just 23.1"


SUBSECTION 4.2: TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS
=======================================

MAJOR RESTRUCTURING

ORIGINAL STRUCTURE:
- Paragraph on scrap-EAF thresholds
- Paragraph on CCUS thresholds
- Paragraph on hydrogen not entering
- Dense, numbers-heavy

NEW STRUCTURE (5 paragraphs):

PARAGRAPH 1: Opening - The Threshold Finding
"One of our most striking findings is how technology deployment responds to discrete price thresholds rather than gradual carbon price increases."
- States what's STRIKING about the finding
- Sets up the mechanism to explain

PARAGRAPH 2: Scrap-EAF Example
- Detailed walkthrough of threshold behavior
- Explains WHY (greenfield investment required)
- Concrete numbers: "jumps suddenly to 22.8%"
- Context: POSCO's current configuration

PARAGRAPH 3: Scrap Ceiling
"Scrap availability then caps further EAF expansion at 35.7%..."
- Explains the binding constraint
- Korea-specific context
- "The binding constraint is not capital cost or carbon price, but physical feedstock availability"

PARAGRAPH 4: CCUS Thresholds
- Parallel structure to scrap-EAF analysis
- Price points: \$165, \$225, \$255
- Explicit economics: "65% capital cost premium"
- What happens in lower-price scenarios

PARAGRAPH 5: What Doesn't Happen - Hydrogen
"Perhaps most revealing is what the model does not choose."
- Emphasizes the absence as informative
- Explains WHY hydrogen doesn't enter
- Challenges conventional wisdom
- Sets up later sensitivity analysis

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Progressive story: one finding builds on previous
✓ Explains mechanisms, not just reports outcomes
✓ Uses parallel structure for comparisons
✓ Explicit policy implications
✓ Challenges assumptions ("Perhaps most revealing...")

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:

ORIGINAL:
"Scrap-based EAF deployment remains frozen at 4.5\% of output while allowance prices stay below \$100/tCO$_2$, then leaps to 22.8\% in 2028 once the Net Zero pathway clears \$110/tCO$_2$."

NEW (expanded):
"Figure~\ref{fig:technology-transition} and Table~\ref{tab:annual-shares-ngfs_netzero2050} show that scrap-based EAF deployment remains essentially frozen—locked at just 4.5\% of total output—while carbon prices stay below \$100/tCO$_2$. Then, once the Net Zero pathway crosses \$110/tCO$_2$ in 2028, scrap-EAF share jumps suddenly to 22.8\% as the model builds a single 9 Mt capacity tranche. This discrete jump reflects the lumpy nature of steel industry investment: POSCO cannot gradually expand scrap-EAF capacity because it must construct entirely new facilities from scratch."

IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Added emphasis: "essentially frozen—locked at"
✓ Explained the mechanism: "lumpy nature"
✓ Made it concrete: "cannot gradually expand...must construct entirely new facilities"
✓ Connects to real-world constraints


SUBSECTION 4.3: CARBON BUDGET COMPLIANCE
=========================================

COMPLETE RESTRUCTURING - Most Important Finding

ORIGINAL STRUCTURE:
- Numbers paragraph
- Brief interpretation
- Technical details about free allocation

NEW STRUCTURE (6 paragraphs):

PARAGRAPH 1: Direct Answer to Research Question
"We now confront the central research question: can carbon pricing drive investment decisions that remain within climate-consistent carbon budgets? The answer is unequivocal: no."
- Explicit connection to research question from intro
- Clear, direct answer
- Sets up detailed justification

PARAGRAPH 2: The Numbers
Presents cumulative emissions systematically:
- Net Zero: +80 MtCO₂ (+7.2%)
- Below 2°C: +603 MtCO₂ (+54%)
- NDCs: +871 MtCO₂ (+78%)
Using bullet points for scannability

PARAGRAPH 3: Put Numbers in Perspective
"Let us put these numbers in perspective."
- Interprets what +603 MtCO₂ MEANS
- "More than half the entire allocated budget"
- Makes abstract concrete
- Characterizes NDC case: "simply catastrophic"

PARAGRAPH 4: Even Net Zero Fails
"Even the most ambitious Net Zero scenario overshoots by 80 MtCO₂..."
- Emphasizes this is NOT just about weak policies
- "Particularly revealing"
- Implications: need \$450+ OR complementary policies

PARAGRAPH 5: The Price-Abatement Relationship
"The cumulative gap maps directly onto a carbon price gap."
- Calculates marginal abatement: \$100/tCO₂ → 226 MtCO₂
- Derives what it would take: "\$500/tCO₂"
- Quantifies the policy challenge

PARAGRAPH 6: Free Allocation Problem
"Free allocation exacerbates this problem substantially."
- Calculates actual ETS exposure: only 6% under Net Zero!
- Explains why high nominal prices don't work
- States required interventions clearly

PARAGRAPH 7: Emissions Intensity Context
- Connects to Figure showing intensity trends
- Reinforces need for "wholesale technology replacement"

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Organized around answering THE central question
✓ Progressive revelation: numbers → interpretation → implications
✓ Multiple forms of analysis: absolute, percentage, per-ton
✓ Explicit policy prescriptions
✓ Connects back to intro and forward to discussion

EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION:

ORIGINAL:
"Compared with POSCO's 1{,}110~MtCO$_2$ allocation, the Net Zero scenario still overshoots by 79.6~MtCO$_2$ (+7.2\%), while Below~2$^\circ$C exceeds the budget by 603~MtCO$_2$ (+54\%) and the NDC trajectory by 871~MtCO$_2$ (+78\%)."

NEW (expanded across paragraphs):
Presents as structured bullets, THEN adds:
"Let us put these numbers in perspective. The Below 2°C overshoot of 603 MtCO$_2$ represents more than half the entire allocated budget—POSCO would need to cut an additional 35\% from its optimized emission pathway to achieve compliance. The NDC overshoot of 871 MtCO$_2$ is simply catastrophic from a climate perspective, representing nearly 80\% excess emissions above the budget.

Even the most ambitious Net Zero scenario overshoots by 80 MtCO$_2$, or 7.2\%. This residual gap is particularly revealing because it persists despite carbon prices reaching \$450/tCO$_2$ by 2050—levels far beyond anything currently implemented in carbon markets globally."

IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Interprets the numbers (not just stating them)
✓ Adds context: "more than half," "catastrophic"
✓ Calculates additional cuts needed: "35%"
✓ Emphasizes policy challenge: "far beyond anything currently implemented"
✓ Multiple paragraphs instead of dense single sentence


SUBSECTION 4.4: COST STRUCTURE
===============================

MAJOR ENHANCEMENT - The Counterintuitive Finding

ORIGINAL:
- Dense paragraph with cost numbers
- Brief interpretation
- Technical details

NEW STRUCTURE (4 paragraphs):

PARAGRAPH 1: The Counterintuitive Result
"A counterintuitive but important finding emerges when we examine total system costs: more ambitious carbon pricing actually lowers lifetime costs rather than raising them. This result challenges common industry narratives..."
- Opens with the SURPRISE
- Challenges conventional wisdom
- Sets up explanation

PARAGRAPH 2: The Numbers
- Systematic presentation: Net Zero \$791B vs NDC \$842B
- Per-tonne breakdown
- "At first glance, this seems paradoxical"

PARAGRAPH 3: The Mechanism
"The mechanism is straightforward: ambitious pricing allows firms to substitute upfront capital investment in low-carbon technologies for recurring carbon compliance payments."
- Explains the LOGIC clearly
- NDC case: pays \$59.7B in compliance (7.1%)
- Net Zero: pays only \$9.3B (1.2%)
- "The firm redirects cash flow from recurring carbon fees toward productive capital investment"

PARAGRAPH 4: Policy Implication
"The policy implication is powerful: ambitious carbon pricing need not harm industrial competitiveness if it reaches levels sufficient to justify transformative investment. Half-measures...create the worst of both worlds..."
- Direct policy message
- Vivid language: "worst of both worlds"
- Explains what NOT to do

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Leads with counterintuitive nature
✓ Explains mechanism step-by-step
✓ Quantifies the substitution effect
✓ Clear policy implication
✓ Challenges industry narratives explicitly


SUBSECTION 4.5: CCUS SENSITIVITY (New Section)
===============================================

ORIGINAL: Combined with other sensitivity analysis
NEW: Dedicated subsection with dramatic framing

NEW STRUCTURE (3 paragraphs + figure discussion):

PARAGRAPH 1: Setup
"To test how critically our results depend on CCUS availability, we re-run the Net Zero 2050 price trajectory with carbon capture technology completely disabled..."
- Clear motivation for sensitivity
- "Reveals stark trade-offs"

PARAGRAPH 2: Technology Shift
- What happens: H₂-DRI to 35.7%, scrap capped, BF residual
- "The model has no choice but..."

PARAGRAPH 3: The Bad News
"Yet the emission and cost outcomes deteriorate markedly..."
- Bullet list of deteriorations
- "Nearly tripling," "More than quadrupling"
- Dramatic language justified by dramatic findings

PARAGRAPH 4: Mechanism Explanation
Via Figure~\ref{fig:ets-logic}
- Shows WHY costs explode
- "Widening liability gap"

PARAGRAPH 5: Policy Implications
"The No CCUS sensitivity underscores that hydrogen DRI adoption at current cost assumptions requires CCUS..."
- Challenges either/or thinking
- "Cannot simply choose between..."
- Emphasizes complementarity

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Elevated from footnote to major finding
✓ Dramatic presentation justified by stakes
✓ Clear mechanism explanation
✓ Strong policy implications
✓ Challenges simplistic narratives


SUBSECTION 4.6: HYDROGEN SENSITIVITY
=====================================

ORIGINAL: Brief paragraph
NEW: Full analysis with progressive revelation

NEW STRUCTURE (3 paragraphs):

PARAGRAPH 1: The Test
"To test whether lower hydrogen costs could fundamentally change technology choices and budget compliance..."
- Clear research question
- Lists three scenarios tested

PARAGRAPH 2: The Surprising Result
"The results are striking in their consistency."
- Even "breakthrough" case barely changes outcomes
- Quantifies minimal shifts
- "Essentially unchanged"

PARAGRAPH 3: The Extreme Test
"We pushed this analysis to an extreme 'zero-cost hydrogen' stress test..."
- Even FREE hydrogen doesn't solve the problem!
- Explains WHY: capital intensity, feedstock constraints
- "The binding constraints lie elsewhere"

PARAGRAPH 4: Policy Implication
"These sensitivities confirm that policy packages aimed solely at subsidizing hydrogen production would leave the carbon budget gap essentially intact..."
- Clear conclusion
- What's needed instead
- "Simply making green hydrogen cheap will not transform the steel sector"

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ Progressive revelation building to extreme case
✓ Explains the surprising null result
✓ Identifies real binding constraints
✓ Clear policy guidance
✓ Challenges hydrogen-centric narratives
