RESULTS SECTION: TRANSFORMATION SUMMARY
========================================

**COMPLETED: Results Section (Section 4)**
Major transformation from data dump to compelling narrative


KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
================

✓ Doubled length strategically (2,100 → 4,350 words)
✓ Added interpretation to every finding  
✓ Reorganized around clear questions
✓ Integrated policy implications throughout
✓ Challenged conventional wisdom with evidence
✓ Made counterintuitive findings prominent


TRANSFORMATION TYPE: Narrative Restructure
===========================================

BEFORE: Technical Report
- Listed findings sequentially
- Dense numbers with minimal interpretation
- Weak transitions
- Buried key insights
- Policy implications absent

AFTER: Compelling Story
- Organized around central questions
- Numbers support arguments (not ARE arguments)
- Progressive revelation
- Key insights highlighted
- Policy implications integrated


THE CENTRAL NARRATIVE ARC
==========================

QUESTION 1: Do carbon prices work?
→ YES, but not well enough
→ Net Zero cuts emissions 71%
→ BUT still overshoots budget by 7%

QUESTION 2: Which technologies get deployed?
→ Threshold effects, not gradual shifts
→ Scrap-EAF at \$110/tCO₂
→ CCUS at \$165/tCO₂
→ Hydrogen NEVER (at baseline costs)

QUESTION 3: Can ANY price achieve budget compliance?
→ NO - all scenarios overshoot
→ Even Net Zero (+7%)
→ Below 2°C (+54%)
→ NDCs (+78%)
→ Problem: FREE ALLOCATION shields from costs

QUESTION 4: What about costs?
→ COUNTERINTUITIVE: Higher prices REDUCE costs
→ Substitutes capital for compliance
→ Net Zero: \$810/t vs NDC: \$861/t

TWIST 1: Without CCUS?
→ Costs quadruple
→ Hydrogen forced but expensive
→ Emissions worse (+19%)

TWIST 2: Cheaper hydrogen?
→ Barely matters!
→ Even FREE hydrogen doesn't solve it
→ Binding constraints elsewhere


MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS BY SUBSECTION
=================================

OPENING PARAGRAPH
-----------------
Before: Roadmap of section structure
After: Central finding + organizing questions

"Our optimization reveals a sobering but nuanced picture... The central finding is unambiguous: even aggressive carbon pricing aligned with Net Zero 2050 targets fails to keep POSCO's emissions within its climate-consistent carbon budget."


SUBSECTION 4.1: EMISSIONS
--------------------------
Before: Lists emission numbers
After: Interprets what they mean

Added:
- "Carbon pricing works—but not well enough"
- 71% reduction quantified and celebrated
- BUT inadequacy emphasized
- CCUS dependency explained


SUBSECTION 4.2: TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS  
---------------------------------------
Before: Technical description
After: Mechanism explanation

Key additions:
- "One of our most striking findings..."
- Threshold effects emphasized
- WHY thresholds exist (lumpy investment)
- What DOESN'T happen (hydrogen)
- Challenges hydrogen narratives


SUBSECTION 4.3: BUDGET COMPLIANCE ⭐
------------------------------------
Before: Numbers paragraph with brief interpretation
After: Direct answer to research question

"We now confront the central research question: can carbon pricing drive investment decisions that remain within climate-consistent carbon budgets? The answer is unequivocal: no."

Added:
- Explicit connection to intro
- Multiple interpretations of same data
- "Put these numbers in perspective"
- Free allocation problem quantified
- Required policy changes specified


SUBSECTION 4.4: COST STRUCTURE
-------------------------------
Before: Dense cost comparison
After: Counterintuitive finding highlighted

Opens with: "A counterintuitive but important finding emerges..."

Mechanism explained:
- Capital substitutes for compliance
- Why higher prices REDUCE costs
- "Worst of both worlds" for half-measures


SUBSECTION 4.5: CCUS SENSITIVITY (Elevated)
--------------------------------------------
Before: Brief mention in combined section
After: Dedicated subsection with dramatic framing

Key additions:
- "Stark trade-offs" language
- Costs "quadruple"
- Cannot choose EITHER/OR
- Must have BOTH CCUS and hydrogen


SUBSECTION 4.6: HYDROGEN SENSITIVITY (New Analysis)
----------------------------------------------------
Before: Single paragraph
After: Progressive revelation to extreme case

Structure:
- Breakthrough costs: minimal effect
- Zero-cost hydrogen: STILL doesn't work!
- Explains WHY: capital, feedstock constraints
- Policy: "Simply making hydrogen cheap won't work"


SPECIFIC WRITING TECHNIQUES
============================

1. LEAD WITH INSIGHTS
Before: "Emissions are 1,190 MtCO₂"
After: "Even the most ambitious scenario overshoots by 80 MtCO₂—revealing that current trajectories remain inadequate"

2. PROGRESSIVE REVELATION
- Finding
- Numbers
- Interpretation
- Mechanism
- Implications

3. COUNTERPOINT STRUCTURE
"Carbon pricing works... BUT not well enough"
"At first glance... However, the mechanism is..."

4. VIVID LANGUAGE (When Earned)
- "Catastrophic" (for 78% overshoot)
- "Striking" (for threshold finding)
- "Sobering" (for central result)
- Always backed by data

5. RHETORICAL QUESTIONS
"At first glance, this seems paradoxical—how can higher carbon prices reduce costs?"
Then answer immediately

6. EXPLICIT POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Not saved for Discussion—integrated throughout


NUMBERS vs INTERPRETATION BALANCE
==================================

EVERY quantitative finding now includes:
✓ The number
✓ What it means
✓ Why it matters
✓ What it implies for policy

EXAMPLE:

Before:
"Net Zero overshoots by 79.6 MtCO₂ (+7.2%)"

After:
"Even the most ambitious Net Zero scenario overshoots by 80 MtCO₂, or 7.2%. This residual gap is particularly revealing because it persists despite carbon prices reaching \$450/tCO₂ by 2050—levels far beyond anything currently implemented in carbon markets globally. The implication is that budget compliance would require either carbon prices rising well above \$450/tCO₂ in later periods, or complementary policies that constrain production or mandate specific technologies..."

Added:
- Interpretation ("particularly revealing")
- Context ("\$450 far beyond anything implemented")
- Implications ("would require either... or...")


CHALLENGES TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
==================================

Conventional Wisdom → Evidence-Based Challenge

"Higher carbon prices hurt competitiveness"
→ "Higher prices actually REDUCE costs"

"Hydrogen is THE solution for steel"
→ "Hydrogen doesn't enter even at \$450/tCO₂"
→ "Even free hydrogen barely helps"

"Gradual price increases drive transition"
→ "Technologies respond to THRESHOLDS not gradual increases"

"Just raise carbon prices higher"
→ "Free allocation shields firms—price level isn't enough"


POLICY IMPLICATIONS INTEGRATED
===============================

Every subsection includes policy insights:

4.1: "Carbon pricing alone cannot drive sufficient reductions if key technologies remain unavailable"

4.2: "Policymakers need sustained prices above \$150/tCO₂, not just peak prices"

4.3: "Need faster free allocation phase-out OR prices above \$500/tCO₂"

4.4: "Half-measures create worst of both worlds"

4.5: "Cannot choose between CCUS and hydrogen—need both"

4.6: "Subsidizing hydrogen alone leaves budget gap intact"


ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS
===========================

Made technical findings accessible through:

1. PLAIN LANGUAGE
Before: "Emission factor reduction via CCUS retrofits"
After: "Carbon capture cuts emissions from blast furnaces by 80%"

2. CONCRETE COMPARISONS
Before: "603 MtCO₂ overshoot"
After: "More than half the entire allocated budget"

3. EXPLAINING MECHANISMS
Not just WHAT happens but WHY it happens

4. EXAMPLES
"POSCO cannot gradually expand—must construct entirely new facilities from scratch"

5. PERSPECTIVE
"Levels far beyond anything currently implemented globally"
