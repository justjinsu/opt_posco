HIGHLIGHTS

• Net Zero pricing achieves 1,169 MtCO₂ with H₂-DRI at 41% of 2050 steel output

• Moderate carbon price trajectories fail catastrophically (+78% budget overshoot)

• Hydrogen DRI requires sustained carbon prices exceeding $350-400/tCO₂

• Free allocation shields 94% of emissions, undermining marginal abatement incentives

• Comprehensive policy package essential: price floors, CCfDs, infrastructure provision
