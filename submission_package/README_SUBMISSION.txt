KEY FINDINGS FOR HIGHLIGHTS:
=============================
1. Net Zero carbon pricing achieves 1,169 MtCO₂ emissions (5.3% above sectoral budget) with H₂-DRI at 41% of 2050 output
2. Moderate price scenarios catastrophically fail (+78% budget overshoots), demonstrating half-measures are insufficient
3. Hydrogen DRI requires sustained carbon prices >$350-400/tCO₂ for competitiveness
4. Free allocation shields 94% of emissions from carbon costs, undermining policy effectiveness
5. Comprehensive policy package (price floors, CCfDs, infrastructure) essential for budget compliance
